// StepLayout styles
// This file should be minimal since most styles are already defined
// in the main OnboardingWizard.scss
// Note: We don't import the main SCSS to avoid the variable.css issue
// Instead, the styles are already available when OnboardingWizard.scss is loaded

// Additional styles specific to the modular layout can be added here
.step-layout-wrapper {
  // Any additional wrapper styles
}
